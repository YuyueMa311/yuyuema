### This is My awesome website

Hi, My name is Yuyue Ma, and I go by Karol. I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Epidemiology at Columbia University, after earning my bachelor’s degree in Cell and Molecular Biology from UC San Diego. Professionally, I’ve worked across equity research, investment banking, and private equity, with a focus on healthcare and biopharma.
